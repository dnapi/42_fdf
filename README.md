# FdF Project

## Overview

FdF is a graphical project of School 42. The program is a simple 3D wireframe renderer written  in C from scratch using the MLX42 library, which provides minimalistic graphics capabilities. FdF stands for "Fil de Fer," which means wireframe in French. 

The wireframe is displayed in a window with basic controls for translation, rotation, zooming
and color scheme.

## Features

1. **Map Parsing**: Reads the map file containing the coordinates and parse it to obtain the necessary data for rendering.
2. **Graphics Rendering**: Utilize the MLX42 library to create a graphical window and render the wireframe.
3. **Line Drawing**: Bresenham algorithms is implemented for drawing lines between points to create the wireframe representation.
4. **Navigation Controls**: Allow users to navigate (translate, rotate, zoom and change color scheme) through the 3D space using keyboard:

## Learning Objectives
- Gained understanding of computer graphics fundamentals.
- Learned about 3D graphics rendering techniques.
- Practiced working with low-level graphics APIs.
- Enhanced skills in C programming and algorithm implementation.
