# FdF Project

## Overview

FdF is a graphical project assigned to students at School 42. The project's objective is to create a simple 3D wireframe renderer from scratch using the MLX42 library, which provides minimalistic graphics capabilities. FdF stands for "Fil de Fer," which means wireframe in French.

## Requirements

- The program should read a map file containing coordinates that define points in space.
- It should render a wireframe representation of these points, connecting them to form lines.
- The wireframe should be displayed in a window with basic controls for translation, rotation and zooming.

## Features

1. **Map Parsing**: Read the map file containing the coordinates and parse it to obtain the necessary data for rendering.
2. **Graphics Rendering**: Utilize the MiniLibX library to create a graphical window and render the wireframe.
3. **Line Drawing**: Implement algorithms for drawing lines between points to create the wireframe representation.
4. **Navigation Controls**: Allow users to navigate through the 3D space using keyboard.
5. **Perspective Projection**: Implement perspective projection to give depth to the wireframe representation.

## Technologies Used

- C programming language
- MLX42 library for graphics
- Algorithms for line drawing and perspective projection

## Learning Objectives

- Gain understanding of computer graphics fundamentals.
- Learn about 3D graphics rendering techniques.
- Practice working with libraries and low-level graphics APIs.
- Enhance skills in C programming and algorithm implementation.

## Conclusion

The FdF project challenges students to apply their knowledge of graphics programming to create a simple yet functional 3D wireframe renderer. Through this project, students gain practical experience in graphics programming and deepen their understanding of fundamental concepts in computer graphics.
